## v3.0.0 (2024-10-27)

Recently Oznu annouced that he no longer had the resources or free time required to maintain this plugin. So we worked with him to transfer the operational assets of the service over to us, so that we could continue to offer this service for Google Home users.

So at the present time, we have created a new cloud server to support this offering, and have successfully migrated operations over. We want to thank Oznu for his time and efforts over the last few years in creating and running this great service for the community.

Going forward we will be updating the cloud server and plugin code base, to bring its patch level up to date, and making other enhancements as needed.

Thank You
