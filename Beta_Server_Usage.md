# Using the Homebridge-gsh beta cloud server environment

Please note, configuring the beta environment will require you to remove your existing Homebridge Google Smart Home configuration, so if you have a setup you don't want to redo, don't do this.

Before completing this setup, you will need to provide to me your `Google Home` login/email, so I can enroll your account in the Beta service. Please use the Homebridge discord server and direct message/chat to share this.

## Enabling the Beta Test Google Smart Home Action on your Google Account

1 - You should receive an email with the subject `homebridge-beta-22362 is being deployed`

2 - Select the link `Open Console` or this url - https://console.actions.google.com/u/1/project/homebridge-beta-22362/simulator

3 - Authenticate your google smart home account

4 - Select the Test Tab at the top of the screen, and Start Testing. `Version Alpha`

Your google account should now be enabled for testing the skill

10 - A window should appear `Homebridge BETA GSH Google Connection`, and select the same account provider / account you selected earlier.

11 - After a few seconds a screen `Choose Device` will appear. You can use the `X` in the top left corner to skip if you want.

## Additional notes

For some reason, in my configuration I need to restart the GSH plugin, and unlink and re-link in the google home app for all my devices to appear.
